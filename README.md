### About Us

We are a service based company that helps you effortlessly manage your marketing.

Think of us as an extension of your office.

We'll do the work so you won't have to.

At Lift Local, each of our clients has a
dedicated account manager who
personally oversees every aspect of their
account. We are not a software company
which means you won’t have to worry
about any complicated software or
overwhelming dashboards. Everything is
100% service based and hands off for
you. Your account manager will give you
a report each month on your progress
and development. Think of us as an
extension of your office, here to relieve
stress so that you can focus on your
customers.

## Review Generation

---

84% of people trust online reviews as much as they trust a recommendation from a friend.
Our goal is to get you to a position where you are
absolutely dominating the local competition. We want you
to have the most reviews and strongest online reputation
in your area. More reviews ultimately means more
business for you. Consistency with your reviews will
move you up the ranks on Google.

The last thing we want is to bombard your customers with
review requests. Instead, we send personalized emails
asking one simple question, “How would you recommend
my business to a friend or colleague?” The 8, 9 and 10
ratings go directly to Google where your client can leave
you an awesome review! Any rating 7 and below will be
sent to a page where they can send you direct feedback.
This feedback is for your eyes only and will not be public
facing. This is especially valuable as your business
focuses on best practices and customer retention. If a
customer is unhappy and leaves negative feedback, you
will be alerted right away which means you can save that
customer. Imagine how your retention will improve!

## Lead Recycling

---

7 out of 10 leads are not
ready to make a purchasing
decision at first contact.

Most companies spend
thousands of dollars on leads
that only convert at a 15%
rate. So what happens to the
other 85% of unconverted
leads? Is that just money
lost?

We take all of your unconverted
leads and plug them into a lead
recycling email drip developed by
our experienced marketing team.
Leads that opt in are sent to you in
real-time, giving you an easy
opportunity to grow your business.
The emails are sent consistently,
but never aggressively. Our high
response rates come from expert
knowledge of optimal content,
subject lines, A/B testing and
industry best practices.

## WinBack Clients

---

FORMER CUSTOMERS =
STRONG LEADS

Even the best businesses have customers
cancel for various reasons. This can be
discouraging and it’s important to have a
process set in place to get canceled
customers back in the door. In fact,
terminated customers make some of the
best leads as they are already familiar
with your business. You have their
information and you also know why they
left. This creates the perfect opportunity to
win them back.

PROCESS
Strategic email campaigns are built,
monitored, modified and managed by
our team of email marketing experts.
Our goal is to re-engage your former
clients by using timing and tested
messaging to drive high response rates.
Your canceled customers will have the
option to receive an updated quote, get
more information, renew services, etc. If
they opt in, you will receive an alert right
away so that you can contact them
while they are still warm.
